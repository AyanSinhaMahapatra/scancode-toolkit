  "\n",
  " The Source Code version of Original Code may be distributed only under\n",
  "the terms of this License or a future version of this License released\n",
  "under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every\n",
  "copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any\n",
  "terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable\n",
  "version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. Your license\n",
  "for shipment of the Contributor Version is conditioned upon Your full compliance\n",
  "with this Section. The Modifications which You create must comply with\n",

  "\n",
  "  3.2 Required Notices. \n",
  "\n",
  " You must duplicate the notice in  Exhibit A  in each file of the\n",
  "Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source\n",
  "Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a\n",
  "location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to\n",
  "look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You\n",
  "may add Your name as a Contributor to the notice described in  Exhibit\n",
  "A . You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the\n",
  "Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating\n",
  "to Initial Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty,\n",
  "support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of\n",
  "Your version of the Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf,\n",
  "and not on behalf of the Initial Developer. You must make it absolutely\n",
  "clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation\n",
  "is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial\n",
  "Developer for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer as a result\n",

  "  3.3 Distribution of Executable Versions. \n",
  "\n",
  " You may distribute Original Code in Executable and Source form only\n",
  "if the requirements of Sections 3.1 and 3.2 have been met for that Original\n",

  "of the Original Code is available under the terms of this License. The\n",
  "notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable or\n",
  "Source versions, related documentation or collateral in which You describe\n",
  "recipients' rights relating to the Original Code. You may distribute the\n",
  "Executable and Source versions of Your version of the Code or ownership\n",
  "rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different\n",
  "from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of\n",
  "this License. If You distribute the Executable and Source versions under\n",
  "a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which\n",
  "differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer.\n",
  "You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer for any liability incurred\n",

  "\n",
  "  3.4 Larger Works. \n",

  "of this License are fulfilled for the Original Code.\n",
  "\n",
  "  4.0 INABILITY TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR REGULATION \n",
  "\n",
  " If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\n",
  "License with respect to some or all of the Original Code due to statute,\n",
  "judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms\n",
  "of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations\n",
  "and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL\n",
  "file described in Section 3.2 and must be included with all distributions\n",
  "of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation,\n",
  "such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary\n",
  "skill to be able to understand it.\n",
  "\n",
  "  5.0 APPLICATION OF THIS LICENSE \n",

  "of any subsequent version of the License published by Sun. No one other\n",
  "than Sun has the right to modify the terms applicable to Original Code.\n",
